    st.markdown("""
    During my Python programming class using Google Colab, I have acquired fundamental skills in data manipulation, 
    analysis, and visualization. I learned how to use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data 
    handling and visualization tasks. Google Colab's integration with Jupyter notebooks allowed me to practice coding 
    in a collaborative and interactive environment, which enhanced my understanding of Python syntax, data structures, 
    and algorithms.

    st.markdown("""
    As part of my learning journey, I applied my Python skills to develop a web application using Streamlit. 
    Streamlit's simplicity and integration with Python allowed me to create interactive data-driven applications 
    effortlessly. I utilized a dataset from Kaggle to build a predictive analytics app. This involved preprocessing 
    data, training machine learning models (such as regression or classification models), and deploying the model 
    within the Streamlit app. The app enables users to input data, receive predictions, and visualize analytics results 
    using charts and graphs, enhancing my proficiency in both Python programming and application development.

    st.header("Conclusion")
    st.markdown("""
    My experience in Python programming and Streamlit app development has been invaluable. From mastering data handling 
    techniques in Google Colab to building interactive applications with Streamlit, I have gained practical insights 
    into leveraging Python for real-world projects. This journey has not only strengthened my programming skills but 
    also deepened my understanding of data science concepts and their application in predictive analytics and web 
    development.
